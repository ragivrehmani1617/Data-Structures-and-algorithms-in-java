	 * 									Rules of Big O Notation
	 * 
	 * Its a single processor
	 * it performs sequential execution of statments
	 * Assignment operations taes 1 unit of time
	 * Return statement takes 1 unit of time
	 * Arithmetical operation takes 1 unit of time
	 * Logical operation takes 1 unit of time
	 * Other small/single operation takes 1 unit of time
	 * Drop lower order terms
	 * 							Time Complexity	(T) = n^2+3n+1 ==> O(n^2)
	 * Drop Constant multipliers
	 * 							 T = 3n^2 + 6n + 1 ==> O(n^2)
