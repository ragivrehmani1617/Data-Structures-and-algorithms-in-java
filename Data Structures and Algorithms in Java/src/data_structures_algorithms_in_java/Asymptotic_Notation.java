	/*
	 * these are the mathematical tools used to describe the running time of an algorithm in terms of input size
	 * ex - performance of car in 1l of petrol
	 * 
	 * min traffic - 25kmpl
	 * max traffic - 15kmpl
	 * avg traffic - 20kmpl
	 * 
	 * asymptotic notation helps in determining 
	 * 1. best case
	 * 2. worst case
	 * 3. avg case
	 * 
	 * 						
	 * 													Types of asymptotic anotation
	 * there are 3 types 
	 * 
	 * 1. Omega notation
	 * it is the formal way to express the lower bound of an algorithm's running time
	 * lower bound means for any given input this notation determines best amount of time an algorithm can take to complete
	 * 
	 * for ex. 
	 * if we say certain algorithm takes 100 secs s best amount of time. so 100 secs will be lower bound of that algorithm. 
	 * the algorithm can take more than 100 secs but it will not take less than 100 secs.
	 * 
	 * 
	 *  
	 * 2. Big O notation
	 * it is the formal way to express the upper bond of an algorithm's running time
	 * Upper bound means for any given input this notation determines longest amount of time an algorithm can take to complete
	 * 
	 * for ex. 
	 * if we say certain algorithm takes 100 secs as longest amount of time. so 100 secs will be upper bound of that algorithm. 
	 * the algorithm can take less than 100 secs but it will not take more than 100 secs.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 3. Theta notation
	 * it is the formal way to express both upper and lower bound of an algorithm's running time.
	 * By lower and upper bound means for any given input this notation determines average amount of time an algorithm can take to complete.
	 * 
	 * For ex. -
	 * if we run certain algorithm and it takes 100 secs for first run, 120 secs for second run, 110 secs for 3 run and so on. 
	 * So, theta notations gives an average of running time of that algorithm
